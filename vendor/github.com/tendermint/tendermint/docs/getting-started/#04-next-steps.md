# Next Steps

By now you've seen how to run a simple example ABCI application on a local Tendermint node
and on a remote Tendermint cluster. 

To learn more about building ABCI applications and integrating with Tendermint, see the [Developer Guides](/docs/guides/app-development).
To learn more about running the Tendermint software, see the [Using Tendermint Guide](/docs/guides/using-tendermint).

To learn more about Tendermint's various pieces, check out the [Documentation](/docs).
For a deeper dive, see [this thesis](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/9769). 
There is also the [original whitepaper](/static/docs/tendermint.pdf), though it is now quite outdated.

The Tendermint [Software Ecosystem](/ecosystem) contains many example applications and related software built by the Tendermint team and others. Check it out for some inspiration!

For details on how the software has changed, and what changes are in store, see the [Changelog](/docs/changelog) and the [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap).

See our [Community](/community) page for more ways to collaborate.

You can also [get in touch with the team](/contact).

Most importantly, enjoy!
